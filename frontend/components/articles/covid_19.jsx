        1. Give to Animal Shelters in Need
        <br />
        One of the fastest and simplest ways to help a dog or cat amidst Coronavirus is by giving a donation. Fundraisers and events for many pet shelters have been cancelled. Traffic from potential adopters has slowed, but there are still pets coming in, costs for care, and needs to be met.
        <br />
        Visit your local animal shelter’s website to see if you can make a donation online or find animal rescue groups and shelters near you. If your local organization cannot directly take a donation, The Petfinder Foundation can help. They’re currently working overtime during the Coronavirus pandemic to identify and distribute funds to adoption organizations that need it most, and you can donate to them directly.
        <br />
        If you can’t donate funds directly, you can also donate product or supplies to animal rescues—and there’s no need to go directly into the shelter to do it. Just reach out to your local shelter and see if they have a wish list online. Pick a few items and send via mail.
        <br />
        <br />
        2. Adopt a Pet
        <br />
        It’s as true today as it always has been. Adopting a new dog or cat is one of the best ways to help homeless pets. Search for an available dog, cat, rabbit, and more near you. If you find a pet that looks just perfect for you, fill out a pet adoption application, then reach out to the shelter directly to see what their current protocols are, given COVID-19.
        <br />
        Since we’ll all be spending more time at home, it’s a good time to start healthy training habits, form a bond, and get a new pet acclimated to your home.
